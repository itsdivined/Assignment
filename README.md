## 📋 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a used car listings dataset (`cars_price.csv`) containing **8,128 records** across 12 features. The goal is to uncover pricing patterns, clean and prepare the data, and communicate insights through professional visualisations.

## 📊 Dataset

| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| File | `cars_price.csv` |
| Rows | 8,128 |
| Columns | 12 |
| Source | Used car listings (India) |

**Columns:**
`name`, `year`, `selling_price`, `km_driven`, `fuel`, `seller_type`, `transmission`, `owner`, `mileage(km/ltr/kg)`, `engine`, `max_power`, `seats`

---

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing Steps

1. Stripped whitespace from column names
2. Renamed `mileage(km/ltr/kg)` → `mileage` for convenience
3. Converted `max_power` to numeric (float)
4. Dropped 221 rows with missing values in critical columns
5. Removed price outliers using the **IQR method** (Q1 − 1.5×IQR to Q3 + 1.5×IQR)
6. Engineered `car_age` feature → `2020 − year`
7. Extracted `brand` from the car name (first word)

## 📈 Visualisations Produced

Each plot is generated by its own dedicated Python function (one function per plot):

| # | Function | Plot Type | Description |
|---|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | `plot_correlation_heatmap()` | Statistical | Pearson correlation matrix |
| 2 | `plot_price_distribution()` | Statistical | Selling price histogram + KDE |
| 3 | `plot_engine_vs_price()` | **Relational** | Engine size vs price by fuel type |
| 4 | `plot_km_vs_price()` | **Relational** | KM driven vs price by transmission |
| 5 | `plot_fuel_price_boxplot()` | **Categorical** | Price distribution by fuel type |
| 6 | `plot_avg_price_by_seller()` | **Categorical** | Average price by seller type |
| 7 | `plot_fuel_count()` | **Categorical** | Count of listings by fuel type |
| 8 | `plot_transmission_violin()` | Statistical | Manual vs Automatic price violin |
| 9 | `plot_depreciation_curve()` | **Relational** | Price depreciation by car age |
| 10 | `plot_top_brands_by_price()` | **Categorical** | Top 10 brands by median price |
| 11 | `plot_pairplot()` | Statistical | Pair plot of key numeric features |

## 💡 Key Insights

- **max_power** and **engine size** are the strongest predictors of selling price (r ≈ 0.75)
- **Diesel** cars command higher median prices than Petrol cars
- **Automatic** transmission cars have a median price ~2× that of Manual cars
- Price depreciation is sharpest in the **first 5–8 years** of a car's life
- **Dealer-sold** cars are priced higher than individually-sold cars on average
- **Petrol and Diesel** combined account for over 98% of all used car listings
